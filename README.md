# Markup Reference

### Headings
# Main Heading

## Sub-Heading

### Smaller Heading

#### Even Smaller Heading

##### Smallest Heading

And Normal

### Paragraphs
This line has two spaces at the end so that the next line will start a new paragraph.  
Isn't that nice?

This line just has a carriage return at the end
so even though it's a separate line, it just gets shoved on the end of the last line.

However, if you don't want to do the weird two space thing,

Github lets you just add a blank line....

### Style
**Let's do some BOLD**  
*And some italics*  

### Code
This is fun. Here's a command in-line using backticks: `df -h`

And here we have a block of code using three backticks:
```
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "I did stuff with your mom $i times last night"
done
```  
### How about some lists?
**Bullet point list:**
* First Point
* Second Point
* Third Point

**Numbered List**
1. Item one
2. Item two
3. ???
4. Profit

### Blockquotes
> If you've got a lot to say, but you didn't say it,
> Put it in a blockquote.
